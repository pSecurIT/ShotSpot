-- Migration: Add Enhanced Match Events Support
-- Description: Extend event types to support faults, free shots, timeouts, and match commentary

-- Add additional event types to the existing game_events table
-- The current table already supports: foul, substitution, timeout, period_start, period_end
-- We're extending to support more granular event types for enhanced match tracking

-- Note: We're not modifying the existing table structure as it's already flexible with JSONB details column
-- Instead, we'll extend the validation in the application layer for new event types:

-- New event types to be supported:
-- 1. fault_offensive - Offensive fault by a player
-- 2. fault_defensive - Defensive fault by a player  
-- 3. fault_out_of_bounds - Ball out of bounds
-- 4. free_shot - Free shot/penalty shot
-- 5. timeout_team - Team timeout
-- 6. timeout_injury - Injury timeout
-- 7. timeout_official - Official timeout
-- 8. match_commentary - Timestamped match notes

-- Create a dedicated table for free shots to track more detailed information
