- SSL/TLS is enabled for production database connections
- Parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection
- Database credentials are stored securely in environment variables

### API Security
- CORS is configured to allow only specified origins
- Rate limiting is enabled to prevent abuse
- Request size limits are in place
- Helmet.js is configured for secure HTTP headers
- HTTPS is required in production

### Authentication
JWT-based authentication with:
- Secure token storage
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Role-based access control

## Development Security Guidelines

   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Follow the `.gitignore` configuration
   - Regularly audit git history for secrets

2. Code Security
   - Use input validation for all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Keep dependencies updated

3. Testing
   - Include security test cases
   - Test for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate authentication flows
